# VectorBasedFraudDetection
Fraud Detection using Vectorization is a machine learning project that classifies messages as fraudulent or normal based on text data. The project uses various models such as SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with text data being transformed into numerical vectors using techniques like CountVectorizer.
